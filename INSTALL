Installation
============
Install the Pull Into Place pipeline by cloning its git repository with the 
following command.  The --recursive option tells git to also clone the 'tools' 
submodule used by PIP.

$ git clone --recursive https://guybrush.ucsf.edu/gitlab/kortemme-lab/pull_into_place.git

Dependencies
============
In general, there are two types of scripts in this pipeline: those that run on 
the cluster and those that analyze results.  The cluster scripts don't require 
anything beyond Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and the python 2.6 standard distribution.  
The analysis scripts typically require python 2.7 and the full complement of 
scientific python packages.  The view_models.py script additionally requires 
the Gtk2 GUI library, which is often pre-installed on Linux and is probably 
possible to install on other systems as well.  All the packages needed to run 
the analysis scripts are listed below:

python 2.7
numpy 1.9
scipy 0.12
pandas 0.15
numexpr 2.2
matplotlib 1.3
pygtk 2.24
