Installation
============
Install the KicRemodel pipeline simply by cloning:

$ git clone http://guybrush.ucsf.edu/gitlab/kortemme-lab/kic_remodel.git

Dependencies
============
In general, there are two types of scripts in this pipeline: those that run on 
the cluster and those that analyze results.  The cluster scripts don't require 
anything beyond Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and the python 2.6 standard distribution.  
The analysis scripts typically require python 2.7 and the full complement of 
scientific python packages.  The view_models.py script requires GUI libraries, 
as well.  All the packages needed to run the analysis scripts are listed below:

python 2.7
numpy 1.9
scipy 0.12
pandas 0.15
numexpr 2.2
matplotlib 1.3
pygtk 2.24
